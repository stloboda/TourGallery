          Geographical position of Latvia
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          The geographical position of Latvia is extremely convenient. The waters of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga
          are washed by its low-lying shores for 500 km. There are no natural bays, but the built harbors allowed the
          creation of large ports. The open sea near the coast does not freeze, therefore in Liepaja and Ventspils
          navigation does not stop all year round.
